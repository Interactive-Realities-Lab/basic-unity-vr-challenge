# Unity VR Development Test Project for Interactive Reality Lab (Dr. Kopper)

## Overview
This repository contains a bare Unity project set up for VR development. Your task is to demonstrate your Unity and VR development skills by completing the challenge described below.

## Challenge
Create a simple VR interaction scenario with the following requirements:

1. Implement a VR player controller that allows for teleportation movement
2. Create three interactable objects in the scene:
   - A cube that changes color when grabbed
   - A sphere that can be thrown and bounces realistically
   - A button that, when pressed, spawns a new random object in the scene
3. Implement a simple UI element that displays the number of objects in the scene
4. Ensure the project runs smoothly on a VR headset (e.g., Oculus Quest 2 or Mock HMD).

Note: You are encouraged to go beyond these minimal requirements and showcase your creativity and skills.

## Deadline
The project is due 2 weeks after it's assigned.
