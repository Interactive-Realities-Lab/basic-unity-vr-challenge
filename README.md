# Unity VR Development Test Project for Interactive Realities Lab (Dr. Kopper)

This project is a short, two-week challenge designed to help incoming Computer Science PhD students showcase or build a hands-on understanding of virtual and augmented reality development in Unity. The goal is to create an interactive 3D application that demonstrates AR/VR functionality, polished visuals, and engaging user interactions.

## Objectives

1. **Learn Unity and XR Foundations**  
   - If new to Unity, familiarize yourself with Unity’s features for AR and VR development.
   - Explore the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit to set up a VR application.

2. **Design and Implement 3D Interactions**  
   - Create interactive elements in a 3D environment, allowing users to grab, move, or manipulate virtual objects.
   - Integrate physics-based interactions to enhance realism.

3. **Use Quality Visual Assets**  
   - Avoid using only primitive shapes (e.g., cubes, spheres).  
   - Incorporate well-crafted assets—these may be your own or curated from external sources such as the Unity Asset Store.  
   - Ensure consistency in art style, quality, and overall presentation to deliver a visually appealing environment.

4. **Demonstrate Polished User Experience**  
   - Pay attention to scene composition, lighting, and environment design.  
   - Consider user comfort and accessibility.  
   - Include clear instructions or affordances for any interactive elements.

## Project Requirements

1. **Unity Version**  
   - Use Unity 6.

2. **Scene Layout**  
   - Create a small, focused 3D environment tailored to showcase interactions clearly.
   - Ensure users can easily locate and distinguish interactive objects.
   - Set up a Unity project with XR support using the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit.
   - Configure the project to work with a VR headset that you can demonstrate your work on. The IRLab can lend Meta Quests for demonstration purposes.

3. **3D Object Interaction**

   - Develop an interaction system allowing users to grab, rotate, and scale objects using VR controllers or hand tracking.
   - Implement haptic feedback and visual cues to enhance usability.

4. **UI and User Feedback in XR**

   - Create a world-space UI that is interactable in VR (e.g., buttons, toggles, or sliders).
   - Integrate gaze-based selection or direct touch interactions for menu navigation.
   - Implement UI elements that dynamically adjust based on user position and gaze.
   - The UI should exist in the context of the experience, and any interaction with it must cause a 

5. **Assets and Visual Fidelity**  
   - Use at least a few high-quality 3D models to replace default primitive shapes.  
   - Consider consistent color palettes, materials, and shaders.  
   - Employ basic lighting techniques—directional, point, or spotlights—and optionally utilize Unity’s Light Baking or Global Illumination if time allows.

6. **Physics and Constraints in XR**

   - Implement physics-based interactions such as throwing or stacking objects.
   - Apply constraints to prevent unintended object behavior (e.g., objects passing through walls).

7. **Multi-user Networking (Bonus Task)**

   - Implement a simple networked XR experience where two users can interact with shared objects in real-time.
   - Use Unity’s Netcode for GameObjects or Photon to synchronize object states.

## Deliverables

- A Unity project containing the implemented features.
- A short video (2-3 minutes) demonstrating all features in action.
- A concise report (1-2 pages) describing implementation details, challenges faced, and solutions applied.

## Demonstration

- Upon completion of the project, contact Dr. Kopper to schedule a demonstration.

## Evaluation Criteria

The project will be assessed based on:

- **Technical Implementation:** Proper use of XR frameworks, smooth interactions, and code structure.
- **User Experience & Usability:** Clear interaction feedback, intuitive controls, and performance considerations.
- **Completion of Core Tasks:** The number of required features successfully implemented.
- **Innovation & Creativity:** Unique enhancements beyond the required tasks.

## Tips for Success

- **Keep Scope Manageable**: Focus on a single small environment with well-defined interactions.
- **Use Tutorials and Documentation**: Refer to Unity’s official XR documentation and relevant tutorials for guidance.
- **Test Early and Often**: Check interactions in VR/AR devices frequently to address comfort issues.
- **Maintain Version Control**: Even though you are not required to make a pull request, keep your project under version control for your own backup and history (e.g., local Git repository).
- **Optimize** (if time allows): Consider performance profiling in VR/AR to ensure a smooth frame rate.
